What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? Being able to create larger objects from a variety of various shapes.
What design process did you follow for your project work? I kept things as simple as I could and utilized all of the resources at my disposal. I took thing slow, implementing each component seperately until it was perfect before moving on to the next.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? Just being patient and careful and not afraid to fail. There was a healthy amount of trial and error in this project and not allowing that to derail or frustrate me was key.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 
How did iteration factor into your development? So many of the shapes needed similar textures, or similar definition, so iterating on all of that made life much easier.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? Every milestone had a corresponding assignment for the module that I was able to utilize to build the project slowly. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? Thinking about complex images in simple terms, and breaking things down to mathematics will be helpful in a lot of future endeavors.
